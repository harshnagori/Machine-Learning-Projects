### âœ… 1) Rock vs Mine Classification
This project involves building a binary classification model to identify whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal data. The model is built using logistic regression and evaluated using accuracy metrics on both training and test sets. A simple prediction system is also implemented to classify new sonar readings.

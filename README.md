# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects covering a variety of real-world problems. The projects span across classification, regression, clustering, recommendation systems, and neural networks. Each project is self-contained with its own dataset, code, and documentation.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### âœ… 1) Rock vs Mine Classification
This project involves building a binary classification model to identify whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal data. The model is built using logistic regression and evaluated using accuracy metrics on both training and test sets. A simple prediction system is also implemented to classify new sonar readings.

### âœ… 2) Diabetes Prediction  
This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic based on clinical health parameters. The model is built using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel. The pipeline includes data exploration, preprocessing with feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and a predictive system for real-time classification.
